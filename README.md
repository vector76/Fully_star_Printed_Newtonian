# Fully* Printed Newtonian
The purpose of this project is to create a low-cost, easy to build, yet high quality starter telescope suitable for beginners, which can be extended with accessories for more advanced stargazing.

The goal is to lower the barrier to entry as much as possible, without sacrificing image quality.

Lowering the barrier to entry is viewed in terms of cost and also minimizing the effort in sourcing materials and assembling.Â  A parametric design can accommodate many mirror sizes, but depending on the size of mirror that is available (and inexpensive), it may be difficult to purchase a tube of suitable size.  Printing the tube is relatively low-cost, and removes the constraint on finding an existing appropriate tube.  A fully* printed design is not a goal per se, but rather it is a consequence of designing to maximize availability.

Full assembly instructions are available in the included PDF.
